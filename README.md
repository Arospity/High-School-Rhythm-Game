# High-School-Rhythm-Game
A very early prototype to a rhythm game I was making in high school. Never got to finish due to covid. 

The game has a plethora of bugs and has yet to be completed fully. Please do keep in mind.

When playing, execute "My_Game.py" first in order to access the entirety of the game.
